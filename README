I	Basic functionality
----------------------------------------------
----------------------------------------------

Basic functionality of MyllyBot is to connect
IRC server and join currently one channel.
It also supports URL logging and 3rd party 
commands

I.I 	Setting the environment
----------------------------------------------
MyllyBot requires PHP, MySQL and CURL installed
to the server. Easy installation:

	1. Set up the database (see myllybot.db)
	2. Extract all the files to place you want 
	   to run the bot
	3. Set up the bot name and other information
	   from mylly.php
	4. Start the bot by typing 'php mylly.php'
	
I.II 	Basic commands
----------------------------------------------
Basic commands of MyllyBot include:
	
	!addcmd - Adds 3rd party command to the bot
	!commands - Prints all commands of the bot
	!sql - Run SQL clause
	!lastur - Prints out the last URL mentioned
	
	
II 		3rd party commands
----------------------------------------------
----------------------------------------------
MyllyBot can use 3rd party commands to create
content for the IRC channel. Examples of the 
3rd party commands can be found from 
example_commands directory. These commands 
are run anywhere in the world wide web and the
output is returned to the MyllyBot to print 
to the IRC channel. 

Adding 3rd party commands to the MyllBot is 
super easy. Just use !addcmd command and the
command is online:

Adding can be done in the IRC channel the bot is
currently connected by typing:

	!addcmd <command> <url>
	
	where
	
	<command> = Name of the command to use in 
				the IRC channel. For example 
				<command> = youtube - can be 
				accessed with !youtube in IRC
				
	<url>     = URL to PHP file which handles
				the request. For example 
				http://myllyserver.com/youtube.php
