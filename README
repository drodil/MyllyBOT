I   Basic functionality
----------------------------------------------
----------------------------------------------

Basic functionality of MyllyBot is to connect
IRC server and join currently one channel.
It also supports URL logging and 3rd party 
commands

I.I     Setting the environment
----------------------------------------------
MyllyBot requires PHP, MySQL and CURL installed
to the server. You have two options how to install
the bot; either manually or using the installation
bash script.

Installation with script:
    1. Create new database and user for the it
       with access rights at least to INSERT,
       DELETE, UPDATE, SELECT, DROP, CREATE,
       TRUNCATE accesses
    2. Run installation script from the root
       of the tree by ./install.sh and follow
       the installation

Manual installation:

    1. Create new database and user for the it
       with access rights at least to INSERT,
       DELETE, UPDATE, SELECT, DROP, CREATE,
       TRUNCATE accesses.
    2. Set up bot_config.php to configure the bot
       and copy it wherever you like
    3. Change the values of both bot/conf_inc.php
       and www/conf_inc.php to point to the 
       bot_config.php
    4. Copy all the files from bot/ directory 
       to the place you want to run the bot
    5. If you want to install WEB UI copy all the
       files from www/ to the web server directory
    6. Copy the contents of misc/ directory in both
       directories you just copied the stuff for
       the bot and for the WEB UI
    7. Run the database/db_install.php script to 
       create the database or optionally create it 
       yourself
    8. Start up the bot by typing 'php mylly.php'
       in folder you copied the contents of bot/
       directory
	
I.II    Basic commands
----------------------------------------------
Basic commands of MyllyBot include:
	
    !addcmd - Adds 3rd party command to the bot
    !commands - Prints all commands of the bot
    !sql - Run SQL clause
    !lasturl - Prints out the last URL mentioned
	
	
    
II      3rd party commands
----------------------------------------------
----------------------------------------------
MyllyBot can use 3rd party commands to create
content for the IRC channel. Examples of the 
3rd party commands can be found from 
example_commands directory. These commands 
are run anywhere in the world wide web and the
output is returned to the MyllyBot to print 
to the IRC channel. 

Adding 3rd party commands to the MyllBot is 
super easy. Just use !addcmd command and the
command is online:

Adding can be done in the IRC channel the bot is
currently connected by typing:

    !addcmd <command> <url>
	
    where
	
    <command> = Name of the command to use in 
                the IRC channel. For example 
                <command> = youtube - can be 
                accessed with !youtube in IRC

    <url>     = URL to PHP file which handles
                the request. For example 
                http://myllyserver.com/youtube.php
